                        <h3>üêå The Accidental Beginning</h3>
                        <p>
                            Pierre Escargot (yes, that's his real name) was actually a mime who got lost in his neighbor's 
                            garden during a particularly intense "trapped in a box" performance. He accidentally stepped on 
                            a snail, felt terrible, and decided to honor its memory by... eating it with garlic butter. 
                            It was delicious. The rest is history.

                        <p>
                            Pierre tried to diversify into croissants after a fortune teller told him his future lay in 
                            "flaky layers." His first batch exploded in the oven, covering his kitchen in buttery shrapnel. 
                            After 3 years of therapy and 127 failed attempts, he finally mastered the perfect croissant. 
                            The fortune teller later admitted she was talking about his personality.

                        <h3>üé≠ Never Forget Your Roots</h3>
                        <p>
                            Pierre refused to give up his mime career despite his culinary success. He began selling 
                            authentic mime costumes alongside his escargot, reasoning that "people who eat snails are 
                            already comfortable with weird choices." He was right. Sales doubled.

                        <p>
                            Pierre was briefly banned from France after suggesting that snails could be "improved" with 
                            hot sauce. After a tearful 6-hour mime performance in front of the French Embassy (no words, 
                            just emotions), he was forgiven and given a medal for "Culinary Bravery."

                        <p>
                            Pierre's grandson taught him what "the internet" was. After 3 weeks of thinking WiFi was a 
                            type of cheese, Pierre finally understood and launched this website. He still doesn't know 
                            what a "tweet" is and refuses to learn.

                            Still run by Pierre (now 87), Pierre's Escargot serves the finest snails, croissants, and 
                            mime attire to discerning customers worldwide. Pierre himself still performs mime shows every 
                            Tuesday at the local senior center. He's never once used words to describe his products, which 
                            makes customer service... interesting.
