                        <p>
                            After working in tech for 8 years, Pierre quit his job to "pursue his passion" and bought a 
                            vintage 1974 Citro√´n H Van on eBay. He started serving small-batch, sustainably-harvested escargot 
                            from a parking lot in Brooklyn. Each snail is individually named and Instagram-storied. The truck 
                            is powered by recycled cooking oil and good vibes only.

                        <p>
                            During lockdown, Pierre taught himself to make croissants from a YouTube video and called himself 
                            a "master baker." His croissants are made with European-style butter (it costs $47/pound), 
                            heritage wheat flour milled by monks, and are laminated exactly 73 times because "that's the 
                            optimal number according to my artisanal spreadsheet." Each one takes 3 days to make and costs $12.

                        <p>
                            Pierre launched his "ethical streetwear line" featuring hand-screen-printed mime costumes made 
                            from organic, fair-trade cotton. Why mime costumes? "It's about the aesthetic," Pierre explains 
                            while adjusting his vintage glasses. The collection sold out in 6 minutes to people who definitely 
                            won't wear them but will post photos for the 'gram. Each purchase plants 0.3 trees somewhere.

                        <p>
                            Pierre won "Best New Food Truck" from a blog with 47 followers. He immediately added "Award-Winning" 
                            to everything. His escargot was featured in a 3-minute segment on a local morning show at 5:47am. 
                            He now has a QR code for his menu because "paper is so 2019" and insists you follow him on TikTok 
                            to see "a day in the life of an escargot."

                            Pierre launched his Patreon ($47/month tier) for "behind-the-scenes snail content" and a Discord 
                            server for escargot enthusiasts. He hired a social media manager (an unpaid intern) to post aesthetic 
                            photos of snails with minimalist typography. The newsletter has 83 subscribers who get exclusive 
                            access to "drop announcements" for limited-edition seasonal escargot flavors.
